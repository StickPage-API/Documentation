# Adding new entry

{% hint style="info" %}
Before adding a new entry, please take some time to [read the documentation on our JSON Schema](../schema/).
{% endhint %}

## Requirements

The following are mandatory when submitting a new entry to the database.

* **Has a thread entry for applications in** [**StickPage Forums**](http://forums.stickpage.com/forumdisplay.php?51-RHG-Characters) **or** [**Hyun's Dojo Forums**](https://www.hyunsdojo.com/community/viewforum.php?f=47)**.** We can't search around these forums just to look for the application thread. Please give us the link. No link shorteners, please
* **Has a YouTube/Twitch channel.** THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT for identity verification purposes.

### Recommended but optional

* **Has a GitHub or GitLab account with at least 10 contributions in the past 14 weeks.** Nah, we don't care about your contributions count, just checking if you're active in the open-source community.
* **Has other social accounts such as Twitter and Patreon.** Not only this improves our identity verification process, but also checks

## Getting started

### Your own stick character

Before we can process your request, make sure that you started your [RHG](https://web.archive.org/web/20191104230834/http://forums.stickpage.com/showthread.php?33615-Starting-your-RHG) and/or [Duelist](http://www.hyunsdojo.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=6178). Only one character can be added to the database per person. If you want to add more, [see this FAQ entry](add-entry.md#i-want-to-add-2-or-more-stick-characters-i-make-is-it-allowed).

If you're ready to continue, [skip to the process section](add-entry.md#the-process).

### Somebody's stick character

{% hint style="info" %}
**Updating or removing an entry?** See [Updating current entry](updating-entry.md) or [Removing an entry](remove-entry.md) for details.
{% endhint %}

Before adding a stick character that made by someone, please check for any active merge requests in both GitHub and GitLab relating to it. If you found one, it better to join the discussion instead of creating a new one to keep our backlog clean.

## The Process

### TL;DR

* Fork this repository [in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/stickpage/Database-Repository/-/forks/new) \(or [in GitHub](https://github.com/StickPage-API/Central-DB/fork)\).
* \(optional\) Clone your fork locally or open it in Gitpod.
* Copy the `templates/stickpage-entry.json` file to `stickpage/<your-entry-here>.json`, replacing `<your-entry-here>` with your entry name in a URL-friendly style.
* Fill up the fields as possible as you can. After filling up the fields, also append the following text on either `.github/CODEOWNERS`, `.gitlab/CODEOWNERS` or both. After appending the last lines of `CODEOWNERS` file, replace the placeholder username \(`@YOURGHORGLUSERNAMEHERE`\) to your either GitHub/GitLab.com username.

```text
stickpage/stick-character-name-here.json @YOURGHORGLUSERNAMEHERE
animators/animator-name-here.json @YOURGHORGLUSERNAMEHERE
```

* Sign-off your commits \(and optionally sign it using your GPG key\) and push to your fork.
* Create a new merge request and follow the discussion.

## FAQ

### I want to add 2 or more stick characters I make. Is it allowed?

As per current policies, each person can only request ONLY ONE character to be added to the database. If you want to add more than 2 characters you made, please let others add it for you.

If you REALLY WANT to add more, you may edit or remove your current entry as you wish.
